# What is it?
MultiModes is a python code to extract the most significant frequencies of a sample of variable stars

# Input
- Directory with light curves in format .fits, corrected from 'outliers' and 'nan' values. Names of the headings: 'TIME' and 'FLUX'
- ini.txt with the initial parameters: 
  sim_fit_n: Number of simultaneous peaks to be fit before extracting to the original light curve for obtaining the residual: 20 by default
  max_freq: Maximum value of the analysed frequencies domain: 100 c/d by default (delta Scuti stars)
  os_ratio: oversampling factor: 5 by default
  stop: Stop criterion, FAP or SNR: SNR by default
  min_snr: Minimum signal to noise ratio: 4 by default (Breger 1993)
  max_fap: Maximum value of the False Alarm Probability: 0.01 by default (Balona et al. 2014)
  tail_per: Minimum  frequency of the tail of the periodogram: 80 c/d by default (delta Scuti stars)
  
# Output
- Directory 'results' containing subdirectories corresponding to every analysed light curve. Each subdirectory contains:
  - file best_modes.dat, containing the values of the most significant frequencies, amplitudes, phases, corresponding errors and FAPs/SNRs
  - file lc.dat, the light curve in format .dat for using with other codes, such as SigSpec (Reegen 2007)
  - file pg.dat, the periodogram of the original light curve
  - LC.png, the plot of the light curve
  - LS.png, the periodogram
  - LS_n.png, the periodogram obtained every number n of extracted peaks
  - res.dat, with the final residual after extracting the most significant frequencies

# What does it do
MultiModes takes as input a directory with corrected light curves in format fits, taken, for example, from the MAST archive (https://archive.stsci.edu/), and the initial parameters written in a text file, among others, the  maximum frequency of the studied domain, the number of simultaneous peaks subtracted from the original light curve after the fit, or the stop criterion. With every light curve, the code calculates the frequencies spectrum, or periodogram, with the Fast Lomb Scargle algorithm (Press & Ribicky 1989). It extracts the higher amplitude peak and evaluates if it is real signal or due to noise, either by the False Alarm Probability or by the Signal to Noise criterion, it is a decision of the user at the time of choosing the initial parameters. By default it is chosen to use as  stop criterion that S/N is greater than 4, (Breger 1993).
It fits frequency, amplitude and phase through non-linear optimization, using a multisine function. This function is redefined with the new calculated parameters. It does a simultaneous fit of a number of peaks (20 by default).
Then they are subtracted from the original signal and goes back to the beginning of the loop  with the residual, repeating the same process, until the stop criterion is reached. 
After that, the code can filter suspicious spurious frequencies, those of low amplitude below the Rayleigh resolution, and possible combined frequencies. 
This routine has been designed using the astropy packages https://www.astropy.org for the calculation of the periodograms and the lmfit packages https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/ for the non-linear and simultaneous fitting of the extracted signals, using the non-linear least squares method for python.

# How to run it
- Copy the downloaded files MultiModes.py and ini.txt in your working directory.
- Copy in your working directory the directory with the light curves to be analysed.
- In in your working directory, type the command: run MultiModes.py --d name_of_directory_with_light_curves, if you use Anaconda or similar python enviroment, or type the command: python MultiModes.py --d name_of_directory_with_light_curves, if you use terminal unix.
